                        I improved the information architecture for the dashboard to resructure how we organized data displayed to clinicians. <strong>As a front-end technical lead and designer, I balanced development and design goals. </strong>I created and implemented several core features for the platform myself and guided new lab members on both design and development teams.

                    <Typography variant="body2">
                        I worked with a PhD student to conceptualize how shared interfaces for a new patient engagement metric could be conveyed to clinicians and patients. I designed medium fidelity, working prototypes to test with clinicians.

                        An important goal of the dashboard is to allow clinicians to keep track of patient homework assignments, and a key function to this is being able to enter homework assignments.

                        We received feedback from users that the initial method for <strong>assigning homework was cumbersome </strong> because it required <strong>entering each assignment one at a time.</strong>

                        When brainstorming how to address the problem, I was able to <strong>anticipate the development challenges</strong> we would face. Therefore, with a deadline approaching, I made sure to <strong>consider technical complexity</strong> and come up with a solution that best utilized exisitng frameworks and components.

                    <Typography variant="body2">
                        Moving forwards, the assignment adding process still needs more fine tuning. The new system design alleviates the issue of adding multiple of the same assignment at once, but does not account for adding different assignment types. Furthermore, because PE is so manualized, having a preset schedule for certain assignments could help streamline the process more.
